# GardenX
### The app that will help revive your garden. (made by the Avengers FTC team). Developed by myself, @huskynp, and @abhi-node.

Initially developed in 2020, GardenX was a project intended to encourage people to develop their own at-home gardens. The idea is that people who garden and spend more time outdoors will notice numerous health benefits from improved sleep to reduced stress. The app identifies plant species and allows users to upload their garden to their profiles, similar to a social media.
